# Smart-Rockets

A Processing sketch made using the processing IDE.
A simulation in which rockets with no sensory tools are initially launched in random directions. After a certain amount of time they are considered crashed and their data is collected and analyzed to find out which 2 rockets were the closest to their target. Their trajectories and movements are then copied onto the next batch of rockets with only slight variations. This process of launching rockets and exploring the best possible trajectories and velocities continue until one of the rockets hits the target in which case the objective is accomplished. The goal of this simulation is to produce such a manouvering system which allows the rockets to reach the target in the minimum number of batches. 
My implementation is quite basic but still takes many factors into account e.g. distance of rocket from target, time stayed alive without crashing, and whether the rocket hit the target or not.

To run the sketch, you would need the processing IDE.
